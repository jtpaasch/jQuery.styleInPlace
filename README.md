jQuery.styleInPlace
=========

A simple jQuery plugin that lets you change the basic CSS styles of an element in place. 

Simple use
----------

In its simplest form, the plugin works like tihs: to make an element editable, simply select it with jQuery, then call the styleInPlace() method. For instance, suppose we have an <h1> element: 

```html
	<h1>Here is a title</h1>
```

To use the plugin for all <h1> elements, simply do this with javascript: 

```javascript

	$('h1').styleInPlace();

```
